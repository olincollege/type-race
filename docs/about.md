Jacob Likins and Jacob Keller developed **type-race** in May of 2025 as the final project for Software Design, a python and software development course at Olin College of Engineering. Both Jacob's are first year students at Olin and both plan to study Electrical and Computer Engineering (are they the same person...?).
