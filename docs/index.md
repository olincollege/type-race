# Project Summary

**type-race** is an exciting game that puts your typing skills to the test! Choose to race the clock in the single player game mode, or challenge a friend through our local online multiplayer.

When the game starts, you have 60 seconds to copy as much of the prompt on your screen as you can. As you type, the prompt will scroll. If you make a mistake, no worries! Mistakes are underlined in red and can be fixed with the backspace key. In the top left, view the time remaining, your current words per minute, and your opponent's words per minute (if playing multiplayer).
