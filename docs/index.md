# Project Summary

**type-race** is an exciting game that puts your typing skills to the test! Choose to race the clock in the single player game mode, or challenge a friend through our local online multiplayer.

When the game starts, you have 60 seconds to copy as much of the prompt on your screen as you can. As you type, the prompt will scroll. If you make a mistake, no worries! Mistakes are underlined in red and can be fixed with the backspace key. In the top left, view the time remaining, your current words per minute, and your opponent's words per minute (if playing multiplayer).

# Project Goal

Our primary goal with this project was to effectively implement the Model View Controller framework in a large scale project. We sought to use best practices to make our code readable, modular, and expandable in the future.

To push ourselves, we also wanted to make our project feature a multiplayer game mode. We wanted to increase our skills with networking and socket programming in Python.

# Unique Features

- Single player and multiplayer game modes
- Multithreaded networking for efficiency
- Customizable GUI through editing `model/gui.py`
